### Overview

Welcome to the Theater...

This game uses key events to listen for the letters that you type.  If you correctly guess the letter it will reveal in the `_ _ _ _ _ _ _` as you go along! You only get ten guesses per word, so choose wisely...

And it tracks your wins and losses and automatically chooses another word after each.
